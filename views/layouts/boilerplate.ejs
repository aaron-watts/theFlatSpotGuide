        Oh No.. Not another Bootstrap site.. :D:D:D

        Hi, my name is Aaron. I have been learning programming and full stack development.

        This site serves 2 purposes:

            1. To allow me to practise what I have been learning

            2. To provide a tool for a community that I am a part of

        This site serves 3 purposes:

            3. To serve as a portfolio piece

        Yes, I would like a job in programming please. I have no professional experience,
        but I have been working really hard to learn how to google and stack overflow.
        I also really enjoy writing bugs and solving code. 
        
            Offer me work at retrolasered@gmail.com

        This is not my first project, but so far it is my biggest, and I hope it will be
        useful to my skateboarding friends. Please feel free to have a look around :)
